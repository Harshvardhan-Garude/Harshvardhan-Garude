## 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m a Machine Learning Engineer with experience building **production ML systems** and **applied research prototypes**, spanning conversational AI, recommender systems, and vision-language models.

Previously worked as a Software Engineer at **Haptik (Jio)**, contributing to large-scale conversational AI platforms used by **10k+ businesses**, and as an ML Intern at a stealth startup building **RAG-based AI agents** for consumer enterprises.

Currently pursuing an MS in Computer Science (ML specialization) at **Santa Clara University**.

## 🔍 What I Work On
- Recommender systems (ranking, retrieval, CTR prediction)
- Open-set and zero-shot ML (CLIP, vision-language models)
- Representation learning & evaluation
- Applied ML systems: data pipelines, metrics, scalability
- NLP & conversational AI

## 📌 Featured Projects
### 🔹 Open-Set Fine-Grained Image Retrieval with CLIP
- Built a zero-shot image retrieval system using **CLIP ViT-B/32**
- Supports **image-to-image** and **text-to-image** retrieval on unseen classes
- Achieved **98.1% Recall**, outperforming fine-tuned CNN baselines with 90% less compute
- Tech: PyTorch, OpenCLIP, FAISS, t-SNE

👉 *Repository coming soon*

### 🔹 Click-Through Rate (CTR) Prediction
- Trained ML models on millions of ad impressions
- Implemented GBDT, Random Forests, and deep models (DCNv2)
- Improved AUC / LogLoss over baseline feature sets
- Focused on feature engineering for users, ads, and interactions

👉 *Repository coming soon*
